`Ml only performs as per predefines procedures.`
-What distinguishes a machine learning algorithm from a non-machine-learning algorithm, such as a program that controls traffic lights, is its ability to adapt its behaviors to new input.

`A machine learning algorithm is the process that uncovers the underlying relationship within the data` which is  THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL

*Based on input of the generated model the output is a boolean value that indicates the existence of the data input.*


-The task of machine learning, is to learn the function, from the vast mapping space.
Machine learning has a nature of approximation.

## Supervised and Unsupervised.
 A data set called Iris
 Any machine learning problem starts from a data set .

 # Supervised.
 - The data set is labeled. The data set is used to train the model. e.g `Regression {Checking temeperature or house prices}` esssential in tasks such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis and face recognition systems.

 # Unsupervised.
 - The data set is not labeled. The data set is used to train the model.
 the goal is to find hidden patterns, structures and relationships within the data wihtout explicit supervision or predefined outcomes. Wildly used in market research and recccomendation systems

 # Semi-supervised learning
 - The data set is partially labeled. The data set is used to train the model.

 Classification(discrete values e.g boolean) vs regression(continous values) used based o the type of output values.
 Logistic Regression, which gives continuous probability values as output, but it is served to solve the classification problem.

 `Regardless of the machine learning algorithms, one would not be able to learn anything from data that contains too much noise or is too inconsistent with the reality.`
