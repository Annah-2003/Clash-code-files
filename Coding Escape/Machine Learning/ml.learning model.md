`Ml only performs as per predefines procedures.`
-What distinguishes a machine learning algorithm from a non-machine-learning algorithm, such as a program that controls traffic lights, is its ability to adapt its behaviors to new input.

`A machine learning algorithm is the process that uncovers the underlying relationship within the data` which is  THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL

*Based on input of the generated model the output is a boolean value that indicates the existence of the data input.*


-The task of machine learning, is to learn the function, from the vast mapping space.
Machine learning has a nature of approximation.

## Supervised and Unsupervised.
 A data set called Iris
 Any machine learning problem starts from a data set .

 # Supervised.
 - The data set is labeled. The data set is used to train the model. The model is
