`Code Golfing ` is a type of programming challenge aiming to shorten the length of a program. This often results in illegible code, but looking to save the most characters will get you to the core of your language and make you discover mechanisms that will help you better understand how it works under the hood. Some of the files in this repositor contain code golfing techniques.
